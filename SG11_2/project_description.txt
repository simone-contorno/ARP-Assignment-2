# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

    The aim of this project is to measure the speed efficiency when 
    transferring data between a producer and a consumer using four 
    concurrent programs based on different IPC transfer primitives.
    The size of the data is chosen by the user (Max 100 MB)
    through an user interface implemented in the run.sh shell script 
    that allows to execute each program separately.

    The four IPC transfer primitives are :

        1) Unnamed pipe.
        2) Named pipe.
        3) Socket.
        4) Shared memory with circuilar buffer.

## HOW THEY WORK

    The first three programs have similar specifications.
    In these three programs the data are generated randomly
    by a function called randomMessage() that creates data 
    using only numbers (char) from 0 to 9.
    Each programs trasfer chunks of data with a max size of 100.000
    up to reach the total amount of data (chosen by the user) that
    has to be transfered between producer and consumer.
    So the producer use an array of chars, called buffer, to transfer
    100.000 characters at time whereas the consumer creates a file 
    called Message.txt in which it saves each chunks of data sent by the 
    producer.
    The fourth program has some other specification.
    In the case of the shared memory the producer and the consumer
    have to implement a circular buffer as shared memory segment.
    This circular buffer has a size really small (4 KB) respect to 
    the total amount of data (that can be up to 100 MB) so the producer can
    transfers only 4 KB of data at time and as consequence, the consumer can
    reads and saves on the file only 4 KB at time.
    Since the circular buffer is shared by two processes, a writer (Producer)
    and a reader (Consumer), it is a shared resource that must be protected by
    a semaphore.
    In this case there are three semaphores, one to implement the access policy
    to the shared memory, the second one that checks if there is no more space 
    to write and the third one that checks if there are no more data to read.
    Lastly the transfering time of each program is measured using the system 
    call gettimeofday().
