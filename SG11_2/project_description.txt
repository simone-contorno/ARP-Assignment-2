# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

    The aim of this project is to measure the speed efficiency when 
    transferring data between a producer and a consumer using four 
    concurrent programms based on different IPC transfer primitives.
    The size of the amount of data is chosen by the user (Max 100 MB)
    through an user interface implemented in the run.sh shell script

    The four IPC transfer primitives are :

        1) Unnamed pipe.
        2) Named pipe.
        3) Socket.
        4) Shared memory with circuilar buffer.

## HOW THEY WORK

    The first three programs have smilar specification.
    In this three programm the data are generated randomly
    by a function called randomMessage() that creates data 
    using only numbers (char) from 0 to 9; 
    It is saved in a file named Message.txt, generated in
    the root directory. 
    To compute the execution time it is used the function
    gettimeofday().
