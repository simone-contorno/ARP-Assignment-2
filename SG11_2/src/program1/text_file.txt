# PROGRAM 1 -  UNNAMED PIPE

    The unnamed pipe is a specific IPC (Inter Process Communication) 
    transfer primitive.
    In a nutshell, it is a buffer (circular buffer) managed by the kernel. 
    So It is a temporary storage of the data to be transferred between 
    participating cooperative processes,for instance like a father
    and a child process generated using the fork() system call.
    In this case are used two files descriptor : 

        1) The first one is used by the Producer (father) to 
           write the message.

        2) The second one is used by the Consumer (child) to 
           read the message.

## HOW IT WORKS :
        
    This program uses an unnamed pipe to transfer
    100.000 chars at time, in order to transfer an amount
    of data chosen by the user (max 100 mb). 

    The system calls fork() and exec() are used to run together the 
    two cuncurrent processes Producer (which is the father process) 
    and the Consumer (which is the child process).

    ### PRODUCER

        Through the randomMessage() function, the producer generate an
        amount of data with a size chosen by the user.
        Once the date are generated, the producer puts chunks of 100.000
        characters in the Unnamed Pipe and waits for the child.
    
    ### CONSUMER

        The consumer reads this chunks of data from the pipe
        and then it creates a file, called Message.txt, to save them.
