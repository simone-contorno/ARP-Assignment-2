# PROGRAM 3 - SOCKET

    The socket is a specific IPC (Inter Process Communication) 
    transfer primitive.
    It creates a channel of communication
    that can be used by two, or more, processes also in 
    different machines simply knowing the hostname and the 
    port. 
    The only constraint is that if a process wants to 
    write in the socket, another process must be listen 
    on it, otherwise the first process remain blocked. 

    ## HOW IT WORKS :
        
        This program uses a socket to transfer
        100.000 chars at time, in order to transfer an amount
        of data chosen by the user (max 100 MB). 
        
        The system calls fork() and exec() are used to run 
        run together the two cuncurrent processes Producer 
        (which is the father process) and the Consumer 
        (which is the child process).

        ### PRODUCER
        
            Through the randomMessage() function, the producer generate an
            amount of data with a size chosen by the user.
            Once the date are generated, the producer puts chunks of 100.000
            characters in the Socket and waits for the child.
            
        ### CONSUMER

            The consumer reads this chunks of data from the Socket
            and then it creates a file, called Message.txt, to save them.
