# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is composed by 5 processes, each process has its specific purpose and comunicate 
with other processes using two communication IPC methods which are SIGNAL and NAMED PIPE.
The first process is the Command Console that can take in input (from the user) the following 
commands :

	* X and Z axis increase : With these commands the user can increase the speed of motor X
				   and/or motor Z
				   
	* X and Z axis decrease : With these commands the user can decrease the speed of motor X
				   and/or motor Z
				  
	* X and Z axis stop :     With these commands the user can stop the motor X
				   and/or motor Z

Then the commands are send to the two motors through Named Pipes (for more information see the text
file of the process1 directory).

The second process is the Inspection Console that show on the screen the hoist position received from
the motors and can take in input (from the user) the two following commands :

	* Reset Command : Reset the motors speed and position (means that the motors are brought to 
			    their initial positions)
			  
	* Stop Command  : Stop the motors, by resetting the speed.

Then the commands are send to the two motors through Named Pipes (for more information see the text
file of the process2 directory).

The third and fourth processes are Motor X and Motor Z that simulate the motion along X and Z axis,
receive command from Commnad Console and Inspection Console (Reset and Stop/Emergency) and lastly 
send to the inspection console the positions of the hoist, during the motion.
In case of Reset Command or Watchdog signal if the motors position are different from zero (the starting
position) they are brought automatically to the starting position before resetting the motors speed
(for more information see the text files of the Process3 and process4 directories).

The fifth process is the Watchdog that check if the processes are still active in a time range of 60 seconds.
All processes to say to the watchdog that they are still active (they have done or are doing an action) 
sends a signal, so if in 60 seconds no signal is detected, the watchdog send a Reset signal to all processes
(for more information see the text file of the process5 directory).
