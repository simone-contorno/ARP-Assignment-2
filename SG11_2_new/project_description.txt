# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

    The aim is to transmit a message of maximum 1 MB and 
    compute how much time takes the program.

    ## METHODS OF TRANSMISSION

        There are 4 programs that used 4 different method of
        message transmission:

        1) Unnamed pipe.
        2) Named pipe.
        3) Socket.
        4) Shared memory with circuilar buffer.

    ## HOW THEY WORK

        The message is generated randomly using a function 
        that creates its with only numbers from 0 to 9; it
        is saved in a file named Message.txt, generated in
        the root directory. 
        To compute the execution time it is used the function
        gettimeofday().
