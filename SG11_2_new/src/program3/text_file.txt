# PROGRAM 3 - SOCKET

    The socket creates a channel of communication
    that can be used by two, or more, processes also in 
    different machines simply knowing the hostname and the 
    port. 
    The only constraint is that if a process wants to 
    write in the socket, another process must be listen 
    on its, otherwise the first process remain blocked. 

    ## HOW IT WORKS :
        
        This program uses a socket that transmits 100.000 
        chars at time. 

        The function fork() is used to run separately the 
        Producer and the Consumer; this last one is run
        using an exec() function. 

        ### PRODUCER
        
            It opens the socket and waits for the connection 
            by the Consumer; then it writes the message in the 
            buffer and.

        ### CONSUMER

            It connects to the socket created by the Producer,
            reads the message from the buffer and saves its 
            in the Message.txt file.
