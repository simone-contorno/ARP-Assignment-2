# PROGRAM 2 - NAMED PIPE

    The named pipe creates a channel of communication
    that can be used by two, or more, processes in the 
    same machine simply accessing to its. 
    The only constraint is that if a process wants to 
    write in the pipe, another process must be reads 
    from its, otherwise the first process remain blocked. 

    ## HOW IT WORKS :
        
        This program uses a named pipe that transmits 
        100.000 chars at time. 
        
        The function fork() is used to run separately the 
        Producer and the Consumer; this last one is run
        using an exec() function. 

        ### PRODUCER
        
            It writes the message in the pipe and waits for 
            the child.
        
        ### CONSUMER

            It reads the message from the pipe and saves its 
            in the Message.txt file.
