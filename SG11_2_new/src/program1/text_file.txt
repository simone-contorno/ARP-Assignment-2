# PROGRAM 1 -  UNNAMED PIPE

    The unnamed pipe creates a channel of communication
    between two processes that are connected, like a father
    and a child using the fork() function; in this case
    two files descriptor are used: 

    1) The first one is used by the Producer (father) to 
       write the message.
    2) The second one is used by the Consumer (child) to 
       read the message.

    ## HOW IT WORKS :
        
        This program uses an unnamed pipe that transmits 
        100.000 chars at time. 

        The function fork() is used to run separately the 
        Producer and the Consumer.

        ### PRODUCER
        
            It writes the message in the pipe and waits for 
            the child.
        
        ### CONSUMER

            It reads the message from the pipe and saves its 
            in the Message.txt file.
